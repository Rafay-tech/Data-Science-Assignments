# Data Science Assignment - Batch 2  
  
## Instructions  

- **Submission Deadline:** [Insert Dealine]
- **Total Marks:** 100  

## Assignment Overview  

In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understandig of key concepts in data science and apply them to a real-world scenario.  

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (30 marks)  

#### Dataset Description  

Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) provided for this assignment. The dataset contains information about [describe the dataset].  

#### Questions  

1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Perform basic exploratory data analysis, including summary statistics and data visualization.
3. Identify any missing values and propose a strategy to handle them.
4. Create at least two meaningful visualizations to represent the insights gained from the data.

### Task 2: Data Preprocessing (20 marks)  

#### Data Cleaning  

1. Handle missing values based on the strategy proposed in Task  
2. Check for and handle any outliers in the dataset.  

#### Feature Engineering  

1. Create a new feature that [describe the new feature].
2. Normalize or standardize relevant features.

$$ X_{normalized} = \frac{X - min(X)}{max(X) - min(X)}  $$

Discuss the importance of normalization in the context of machine learning.  

3. Create a new feature (Z) that represents the interaction between two existing features (X) and (Y) using the formula:

$$ Z = \frac{X}{Y} $$

Provide a brief explanation of why you chose these features.  

### Task 3: Machine Learning (30 marks)  

#### Model Building  

1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm and train a model.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.  

#### Hyperparameter Tuning  

1. Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.
2. Discuss the impact of different hyperparameters on the model.  

### Task 4: Conclusion and Recommendations (20 marks)  

Write a conclusion based on your analysis and propose any recommendations for future work.  

### Task 5: Advanced Analysis (25 marks)  

#### Question 4.1  

Apply a linear regression model to predict a target variable (Y) based on relevant features (X_1, X2, X_n). Evaluate the model's performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) formula:  

$$ MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$  
  
#### Question 5.2  

Discuss the strengths and limitations of the linear regression model. Propose potential improvements.  

#### Mathematical Formulas  

- Summation (Sigma): $\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$
- Theta ($\theta$): $\theta$
- Pi ($\pi$): $\pi$
- Logarithm (log): $log(x)$

## Submission Guidelines

1. Submit your assignment as a markdown file.
2. Include any necessary code snippets in the markdown.
3. Clearly label each section with appropriate headings.
4. Ensure your markdown file is well-formatted for readability.
